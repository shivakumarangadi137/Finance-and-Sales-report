Tools used : Microsoft Excel 
 Canva (graphic design)
Learnings:1)Performed ETL on the AtliQ Hardware company's existing data .
 2) Used power query for data cleaning process and built the connection to data model .
3) Used Power pivot to build the relation among the different tables present in the data model and created DAX measures for further calculations.
4) Learnt guidelines and presentation method that needs to considered when preparing a report for the company.
5) Conditional formatting to highlight the necessary important data points in the report.

Insights from the report: 
1) From the P & L of fiscal year it can be clearly seen that the company is struggling to reduce it's cost incurred by selling the goods , though the net sales are increasing yet the COGS is also increasing ,for upcoming fiscal year company has to find a way to either reduce COGS or find the other ways.
2) From P & L by months NOV and DEC are major contributors to sales of the company yet again facing the COGS issue ,which needs to taken care.
As far as net sales it had overall exponential growth from 124.8% in 20vs19 to 204.5% in 21vs20
3) In market performance when compared to it's target , the company is lagging behind it's targets in all the markets .INDIA and USA being a red zone for the company in terms of performance.
4)In customer and net sales performance ,the company's net sales grew by 304.5% in 2021 compared to 2020 . Amazon(82.1M), AtliQ e-store(53M), AtliQ exclusive(61.1M) , Sage(20.7M) and Flipkart(19.3) being the major contributors.
